        =>Strings('hurrah')
        =>Boolean(True & False)
        =>Null(sometimes we have to store at least something we use null as a something
                Its a special type of data used as a absence of an object )
        =>Undefined(A variable which is declared but not stored gives us undefined)
2.Object Type(Non primitive type)- user defined data type creates from primitive data type
