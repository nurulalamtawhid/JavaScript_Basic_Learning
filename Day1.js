/* let & var are quite same(both can change the value for further use) but
   but before modern days in js, var has some issues on scoping,
   once the value change its changes all of its scope(functional scope)
   &(block scope). So we should use let insted of var to avoid scoping issues.
   
   
   after decalre a variable if we couldnot assigned its value ,the value will 
   remain undefined untill its defined a value.
